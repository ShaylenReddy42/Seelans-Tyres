## What's the purpose of this project?

This project is a rewrite of my [original college project](https://bitbucket.org/Shaylen/seelans-tyres/src/master/) which - compared to this - was very poorly written and insecure

Originally, it was written using PHP [by force, not choice]. This is written using C# and .NET 6 and 7

It's also rewritten to utilize my Azure and DevOps skills since I had earned Microsoft's Azure Certifications and needed a way to prove my skills with a project

View the AZ-400 that I prepared for and took [here](docs/az-400/README.md)

As of right now, the solution is completed locally and is almost ready for Azure

Initially I intended to make it cloud-native but I'd rather have it cloud-ready since "native" means it only runs in the cloud

The definition of "cloud-native" seems to be up for debate from what I've seen and it makes sense as to why it is one

NOTE: Since this project is a proof-of-concept, the payment system isn't integrated

## Architecture

### Where it started

In the beginning, it was a distributed monolith with a frontend and backend API with a single database shared between both the projects

### Where it is

The API has been broken down into microservices which then invited a backend-for-frontend to have a single point of entry into the microservices from the frontend

The solution now comprises of 10 runnable projects with 17 projects in total

  * Related commits:
    * [implement an api gateway with ocelot](https://github.com/ShaylenReddy42/Seelans-Tyres/commit/ce2817ea68efdd1de72d4b941d654d09cfe1d537)

## Build instructions

* NOTE: If you use `build-with-docker.cmd`, I recommend you pull these images beforehand:

``` bat

docker pull elasticsearch:7.17.9
docker pull kibana:7.17.9
docker pull nginx:latest
docker pull rabbitmq:3-management
docker pull redis:latest

docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0-alpine
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0-alpine

docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0-alpine
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0-alpine

docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest

```

* If you use `build-with-services.cmd`, pull only these images beforehand:

``` bat

docker pull elasticsearch:7.17.9
docker pull kibana:7.17.9
docker pull rabbitmq:3-management

```

* Ensure to set environment variables listed in the `RequiredEnvironmentVariables.txt` file
  * Press <kbd>ü™ü</kbd> and search for `Edit environment variables for your account`
  * When setting this for the first time, restart your computer
* All build scripts are in the `scripts` folder
* In order to build, I've provided four options for you:
  * `build.cmd` which is the regular build
  * `build-with-docker.cmd` to run with docker-compose
  * `build-with-services.cmd` which is the regular build + elasticsearch, kibana and rabbitmq orchestrated with docker-compose
  * Kubernetes:
    * All scripts for Kubernetes are in the `scripts/kubernetes` folder and should be run in order
      * `00-applied-once.cmd`
        * Note: This adds the nginx ingress to the cluster from the original repo
      * `01-build-images.cmd`
      * `02-deploy.cmd`
      * `03-delete.cmd`

* Once you run either `build.cmd` or `build-with-services.cmd`, CMake will generate `run-all.cmd`
* Thereafter, run `run-all.cmd` which will start all applications minimized and launch the site, simulating orchestration
